## Deployment Methods

### Docker Compose Deployment

>[!TIP]
>📌 **Note**: If the server has limited memory (RAM ≤ 512MB), it is recommended to use the `nanyangzesi/tgdrive:server-latest` image.

1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

   ```yaml
   services:
     tgdrive:
       image: nanyangzesi/tgdrive:latest
       container_name: tgdrive
       ports:
         - "8085:8085"
       volumes:
         - ./db:/app/db
       restart: always
   ```

2. Start the service:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Update Image

After mounting the data volume, you only need to pull the latest image and restart the container to update. Database data will not be lost:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

### Docker Deployment

Basic deployment command:

```bash
docker pull nanyangzesi/tgdrive:latest
docker run -d -p 8085:8085 --name tgdrive --restart always nanyangzesi/tgdrive:latest
```

#### Migrate Previous Data
> [!TIP]
> Starting from v0.0.9, you can directly download the database and restore file data from the database in the admin interface.

If you have already run the project and generated database files inside the container, you can manually migrate this data to a persistent directory on the host:

1. Find the old container's ID or name:

   ```bash
   docker ps -a
   ```

2. Copy the database files from the container to the host:

   ```bash
   docker cp <container_name_or_id>:/app/db ./db
   ```

   - Replace `<container_name_or_id>` with the actual container identifier.
   - This copies the contents of the `/app/db` folder inside the container to the `db` folder in the current directory on the host.

3. Restart the project:

   Using the updated `docker-compose.yml`, restart the project:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. Verify data:

   After starting, the project should be able to read the data from the host's `./db` folder.

### Self-Hosting

Prerequisites:

- Java 17 or higher

Deployment Steps:

1. Go to the [release page](https://github.com/SkyDependence/tgDrive/releases) to download the latest binary package.
2. Navigate to the directory where the downloaded binary package is located.
3. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   java -jar [latest_binary_package_name.jar]
   ```

   For example:

   ```bash
   java -jar tgDrive-0.0.2-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```

4. After successful execution, access `localhost:8085` in your browser to start using it.

### Render Deployment
